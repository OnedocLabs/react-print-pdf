In this section we will show you how can you generate and host a .pdf using [Onedoc's SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onedoc/client).

<Warning>
  Onedoc is currently in public beta mode.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:

- [Sign-up/in to Onedoc](https://app.onedoclabs.com/login)
- [Generate your API Key](https://app.onedoclabs.com/login)

## 1. Installation

<Tip>
  Want to get started without a project? We have setup a [simple
  CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/onedoc-template-invoice-forked-jdyw6j?embed=1&file=%2Findex.tsx)
  for you to try out.
</Tip>

If you did not have set up a NodeJS project, you can use the following command to do so: 

```sh npm
npm init -y
```

Get the Onedoc Node.js SDK

<CodeGroup>

```sh npm
npm install -s @onedoc/client
```

```sh yarn
yarn add @onedoc/client
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm add @onedoc/client
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Create a document template

Create a `components` directory using the following command:

```sh terminal
mkdir components
```

Then create your document template on `components/pdf-template.jsx`.<br/>Your file must export a React component.

```javascript components/pdf-template.jsx
import * as React from "react";

export const PDFTemplate = ({ name }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1> Hello {name} !</h1>
    </div>
  );
};
```

and optionally, a stylesheet named `stylesheet.css`, in the `root` directory:

```css ./stylesheet.css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

## 3. Generate your PDF

Create a new file `generate.tsx', import the React document template and generate a PDF using your `ONEDOC_API_KEY` and your main React component.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript generate.tsx
import React from "react";
import { PDFTemplate } from "./components/pdf-template";
import { Onedoc } from "@onedoc/client";
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from "fs";
import { renderToString } from "react-dom/server";
import { join } from "path";

const ONEDOC_API_KEY = "####-####-####-####"; // replace with your api key

(async () => {
  const onedoc = new Onedoc(ONEDOC_API_KEY);

  let doc = {
    html: renderToString(<PDFTemplate name="Bruce Wayne" />),
    title: "Hello",
    test: true, // if true, produce a PDF in test mode with a Onedoc's watermark 
    save: true, // if true, host the document and provide a download link in the console and your Onedoc's dashboard
    expiresIn: 30, // the number of day you want to host your document
    assets: [
      {
        path: "./stylesheet.css",
        content: readFileSync(join(process.cwd(), "stylesheet.css")).toString(),
      },
    ],
  };

  const { file, link, error, info } = await onedoc.render(doc);

  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  console.log(link);
})();
```

</CodeGroup>

You are almost done ! Run the script using the following command : 

```sh terminal
npx tsx ./generate.tsx
```


Stylesheets and other referenced assets should be passed in the `asset` parameter. If you are using a framework such as Tailwind, you must submit a <b>compiled stylesheet</b> that can be applied to a HTML file that contains the compiled React component. <br/>

You must upload the content of your asset in string or Buffer format in the `content` field.

## 4. Congratulations !

You just created your first PDF using Onedoc Node.js + React SDK. You can now access your private [dashboard](https://app.onedoclabs.com/) to preview and download your PDF. <br/>
